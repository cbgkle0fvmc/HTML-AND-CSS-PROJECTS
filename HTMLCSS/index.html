                        Grace Murray Hopper was a pioneer in coding and in making computers user-friendly. She invented
                        several tools that helped to simplify coding, and the language computers understand. Her work
                        with the United States Navy during both World War II and Vietnam was instrumental in the
                        development of technology as it exists today. Standards she put in place in the 1970s for the
                        Navy are still used today and officially accepted by the National Institute of Standards and
                        Technology.

                In 1943, Grace Hopper joined the United States Navy under a special waiver after being previously denied
                due to her small size. She became part of the Women's Reserve and was assigned to a lab at Harvard
                University, where she was part of an ongoing Bureau of Ships and Computation project. There, she worked
                with Howard Aiken, another computer pioneer, on his Mark I computer (also known as the IBM Automatic
                Sequence Controlled Calculator). Hopper was one of three of the first programmers for Mark I and also
                wrote the user manual for it. Other wartime work included calculations of rocket ranges and
                trajectories, calibrating minesweepers, and aiding with the math used to develop the Nagasaki bomb.

                She left the Navy in 1946 when she was denied a regular commission due to her age. She stayed at Harvard
                until 1949 when she left and began working in the private sector. Despite being in the private sector,
                however, Hopper was able to remain a Navy Reservist. Age restrictions again forced her out of this
                position in 1966. She later described it as "the saddest day of my life."

                The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) is an annual conference that brings together
                women and nonbinary people in the tech industry. The 2023 GHC in Orlando, Florida was met with
                controversy after many men showed up at the career expo, which was intended to be a space for women and
                nonbinary tech workers.

                The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) is a series of conferences designed to bring
                the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. It is the world's largest
                gathering of women and non-binary technologists.
